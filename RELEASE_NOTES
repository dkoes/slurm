RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 20.11

IMPORTANT NOTES:
If using the slurmdbd (Slurm DataBase Daemon) you must update this first.

NOTE: If using a backup DBD you must start the primary first to do any
database conversion, the backup will not start until this has happened.

The 20.11 slurmdbd will work with Slurm daemons of version 19.05 and above.
You will not need to update all clusters at the same time, but it is very
important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before updating
any other clusters making use of it.

Slurm can be upgraded from version 19.05 or 20.02 to version 20.11 without loss
of jobs or other state information. Upgrading directly from an earlier version
of Slurm will result in loss of state information.

If using SPANK plugins that use the Slurm APIs, they should be recompiled when
upgrading Slurm to a new major release.

NOTE: Slurmctld is now set to fatal in case of computing node configured with
      CPUs == #Sockets. CPUs has to be either total number of cores or threads.

NOTE: The FastSchedule option has been removed. The FastSchedule=2 functionality
      (used for testing and development) is available as the new
      SlurmdParameters=config_overrides option.

HIGHLIGHTS
==========
 -- The example systemd unit files have been changed to the "simple" type of
    operation, and the daemon will now run in the foreground within systemd
    instead of daemonizing itself.
 -- Log messages enabled by the various DebugFlags have been overhauled, and
    will all print at the verbose() level, and prepend the flag name that is
    associated with a given log message.
